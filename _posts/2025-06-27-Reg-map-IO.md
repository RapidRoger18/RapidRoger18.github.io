As mentioned in the last post I had completed testing Memory mapped I/O and discovered some big red flags. While trying to figure out these issues I had an idea, to map the I/O on registers. Now these wouldn't be traditional register mapped I/O about which We'll talk later on, but these would be memory mapped registers while each bit of the register represents a I/O pin.

Thus we could have a Input register a Output register and a output enable register which would fit easily with the already present CAPE module on BeagleV-Fire. During the time of planning this approach I had lots of discussion with my mentors as this wasn't exactly fastes approach but other known approaches would include adding custom instructions for I/O operations, thus modifying the compiler for the same which would complicate the project and would go out of scope for a GSOC project.
